# go-randomx

## Algorithms

random-x series

## Usage

This repo will auto-download the latest `librandomx.a` binary from https://github.com/ngchain/RandomX which currently is RandomNG algorithm. So you can directly import this and go.mod will handle all matters.

If you wanna use go-randomx for other variant, fork your RandomX, and then add the github actions & workflows from https://github.com/ngchain/RandomX into yours, finally edit `./ci/download-librandomx.py` and push this to github
